1. Create java files to make this code compile and run.

2. What five objects are created in the main?
    3 Dog objects (2 Fidos, and 1 Alfie), and ArrayList of type Dog, and a Comparator of type Animal.

3. Can you spot the Comparator constructor call? Where is the class definition for the Comparator?
    The Comparator constructor call is used as a parameter in the sort method.
